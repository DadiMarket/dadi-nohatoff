# dadi-nohatoff

This project is a script for FiveM developed in LUA that prevents players from losing accessories, such as glasses and hats, when they are hit by another player or an NPC in the game. This script is particularly useful for FiveM servers that want to ensure their players do not lose their accessories due to any type of hit.
